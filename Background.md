# Background

## Teaching and Supervision
I am currently  involved in teaching the following modules at the University of York:
- L004M - Sociophonetics (PG module) - course convenor
- L017M - Introduction to Forensic Speech Science (PG module)

In April 2019 I organised and convened a workshop on Forensic Phonetics for advanced UG and PG forensic linguistics students in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University.

During my PhD, I taught on the following modules at the University of York:
- L009C - Introduction to Phonetics and Phonology (First year UG module)
- L010I - Intermediate Language Variation and Change (Second year UG module)
- L098M - Quantitative Methods (PG module)
- L005H - Forensic Phonetics (Final year UG module)


## Forensic Casework
Between March 2016 and June 2022 I worked as a forensic speech scientist at [J P French Associates](https://www.jpfrench.com/) in York.  I primarily carried out speaker comparison analysis but was also involved in transcription and speaker profiling tasks. Outcomes and conclusions were provided to assist with legal proceedings, both as written reports and through providing oral testimony in court when called. 

Although not routinely carrying out casework, I have been involved in over 450  cases in total, and produced written reports as a single author in over 150 speaker comparison cases applying the combined auditory-acoustic analysis method. I have given oral testimony in UK courts six times.


## Professional activities

I am a member of the [International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA)](https://www.iafpa.net/) and the [British Association of Academic Phoneticians (BAAP)](https://www.baap.ac.uk/).

At the University of York, I am co-chair of the Department of Language and Linguistic Science's Early Career Forum and a member of the SOVOT (Sounds, Voices and Technology) network.

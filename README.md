# About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate on the ESRC-funded [Person-specific Automatic Speaker Recognition](https://pasr.york.ac.uk/home) project in the [Department of Language and Linguistic Science](https://www.york.ac.uk/language/) at the University of York. 

My primary research interests are in forensic speech science and sociophonetics. My PhD investigated the development of contact varieties in the British cities Bradford and Leicester. I analysed speech from recordings of community members using auditory, acoustic, automatic and articulatory methods. I worked for six years as a forensic consultant at J P French Associates where I specialised in speaker comparison and transcription. Since July 2022 I have been working as a PDRA on an ESRC funded project at the University of York exploring speaker specific impacts on automatic speaker recognition performance (ES/W001241/1). Since my PhD, I have regularly taught on a variety of modules in sociophonetics and forensic speech science at the University of York as well as other workshops and training. 

Further information on teaching and casework experience is available in the background section, with publications and invited talks listed separately.  My full CV is [available online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1JgjGKms8ZxI3QZ6p1wHTNxbC-qYmbB/view).
